## Telegram

A Telegram theme based on [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord) is provided, but must be manually installed (as far as I know).

## Background script

[A script](bg/.fehbg) for setting the background image is provided, the background image is not though. This script is called at startup in the i3 config file.

Some custom shortcuts different from default are set in my config.
